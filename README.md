# MovieChoice

This project was developed using python 3.7.0 and Django version 2.1.1

MovieChoice is a web application that utilizes machine learning to recommend movies to watch based the the user's movie preferences.  Specifically, the application implements a user-user collaborative filtering algorithm using the MovieLens 100k dataset. 

The application prompts the user to rate several movies from one to five.  It then produces a list of the top five recommended movies out of all the movies for which the algorithm computes a predicted rating.    

### How to run the program
Once you have cloned the repository and navigated to the MovieChoice directory, start the web server by running the command: 
**python manage.py runserver**

The output of the previous command will contain the address at which the application is hosted.  Just follow the link.  


Note, you will need to have Python and Django installed.
