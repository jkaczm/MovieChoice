        <h1>What is Movie Choice</h1>
        <p>Movie Choice is a web application that recommends movies for you to watch based on your preferences.</p>
        <h1>How to use it</h1>
        <p>All you have to do is provide a bit of information about what kinds of movies you like and dislike. Click on
            one of the movies you have seen,
            give it a rating from one to five, then click submit. You must do this at least eight times to provide
            enough information so that the algorithm
            can provide meaningful recommendations.
        </p>
        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p>Movie Choice implements a user-user collaborative filtering algorithm.</p>
        <p>Behind the scenes there is a database of over 100,000 records of
            movie ratings given by over 10,000 users. The machine learning algorithm compares your ratings to the
            ratings other users provided and then
            predicts what rating you would give to other movies in the database and then returns the movies you are
            predicted to give the highest rating.
        </p>
        <p>The database the algorithm uses can be found here: <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/">MovieLens
                100k database</a>.</p>
        <p>A pdf with the description of the algorithm can be found here: <a href="http://files.grouplens.org/papers/FnT%20CF%20Recsys%20Survey.pdf">Collaborative
                Filtering Recommendation Systems</a>.</p>
        <h3>A high level description of the algorithm</h3>
        <p>Basically, for a given movie in the database that you haven't selected, the algorithm predicts what you
            would rate it by taking the weighted average of other user's rating of that movie, where
            the weights are calculated according to a correlation function that measures how similar your preferences
            are to the user's. The only users the algorithm considers are users who have movies rated in common with
            you (which is why you need to rate more than a few movies. The more, the better).
        </p>
        <p>The correlation function calculates the pearson correlation among the ratings for the movies you and the
            user have rated in common.
            Each user in the database has rated many movies.
        </p>
        <p>To make predictions more accurate, it is not actually your predicted rating the algorithm calculates (I know
            that's what it says in
            the previous paragraph, but I lied); it calculates the amount by which your predicted rating differs from
            your average rating, and then
            calculates your predicted rating from that. Similarly, it's not actually taking the weighted averages of
            you and the other users'
            ratings of movies, it is taking the weighted average of the differences between your two ratings, and also
            that is what the pearson correlation calculates.
            (Just replace everythign I said before in the previous paragraphs by "the amount by which your predicted
            rating differs from your average rating.
            I only lied to make everything easier to explain.").
